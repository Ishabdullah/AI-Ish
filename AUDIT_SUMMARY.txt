================================================================================
                            RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

HIGH RISK (70%+ probability of issue):
- ~~QNN SDK availability~~ ✅ RESOLVED (using NNAPI instead)
- Device-specific bugs (mitigation: test on real hardware)
- Testing inadequacy (mitigation: 100+ beta testers)

MEDIUM RISK (40-60% probability):
- Performance not meeting targets (mitigation: INT4 quantization fallback)
- Scope creep (mitigation: strict MVP scope)
- Team attrition (mitigation: documentation, modularity)

LOW RISK (<40% probability):
- Memory exhaustion (12GB device has headroom)
- Model accuracy issues (using proven models)
- Regulatory changes (privacy-first approach future-proof)

Contingency Plans Available: Yes (CPU-only launch, feature deferral, partner approach)

================================================================================
                          QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Can we launch today?
A: No. App returns fake AI responses, has no privacy policy, uses debug 
   signing key. Google Play would reject it immediately, users would give 
   1-star reviews.

Q: How long until we can launch?
A: 8-12 weeks with full-time team. NNAPI integration is complete.
   Critical path is now JNI implementation (2-3 weeks).

Q: What's the biggest blocker?
A: JNI methods don't call real inference. nativeLoadModel() returns false, 
   nativeGenerate() returns hardcoded tokens. Need to implement actual 
   llama.cpp integration.

Q: Will this be better than ChatGPT?
A: No. 7B model can't compete with 175B model. But it offers privacy, 
   offline, free forever. Different value proposition.

Q: How many users will we get?
A: Realistically 5,000-50,000. Not mass market (requires S24 Ultra, 
   niche privacy interest). But could be very useful for its target 
   audience.

Q: What skills are needed?
A: Senior C++ developer (critical), Android dev (supportive), QA/testing 
   (important). Not a junior-friendly project.

Q: Can we skip NPU integration?
A: NNAPI integration is already complete! Vision models run on NPU via
   TFLite NNAPI delegate. LLM runs on CPU (NNAPI not suited for transformers).

Q: What's the revenue potential?
A: Minimal. Free app, offline, no ads, privacy-first. Could do 1% 
   optional subscription ($3/mo) = $150-1,500/month max. This is a 
   labor-of-love project, not a money-maker.

Q: Is the code production-quality?
A: Kotlin/Android layer: Yes, absolutely. Native layer: No, only stubs. 
   Documentation: Yes, excellent.
